# Breast Cancer Patient Analysis 🩺🎗️

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer patient data to uncover insights related to patient demographics, cancer stages, survival rates, and other key health indicators. The analysis was conducted using **Power BI**, leveraging data visualization techniques to present the findings effectively.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Attributes**:
  - Age, Race, Marital Status
  - Cancer Stages (T, N, and 6th Stage)
  - Tumor Differentiation
  - Estrogen & Progesterone Status
  - Survival Months
  - Other Clinical Indicators

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Download Dataset**: Obtained from Kaggle.
2. **Import into Power BI**: Loaded the dataset into Power BI.
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.
   - Converted categorical values for better representation.
   - Performed transformations using **Power Query**.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified key trends in patient demographics and cancer stages.
   - Analyzed survival rates across different cancer stages.
5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Designed interactive visualizations to represent key findings.
   - Implemented filters for Race and Age groups.
6. **Insights & Reporting**:
   - Derived insights related to patient survival, treatment patterns, and high-risk groups.
   - Compiled a detailed analysis report.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Age Distribution by Cancer Stage**
- **Survival Rate Analysis**
- **Tumor Differentiation & Estrogen/Progesterone Status**
- **T vs. N Stage Correlation**
- **Marital Status & Cancer Prevalence**

## 🔑 Key Findings
- The **average age** of patients is **53.98 years**.
- Most patients fall into **Stage IIA & IIB**.
- **Survival rates decrease** as the cancer stage progresses.
- **Marital status impacts prevalence**, with married individuals having a higher recorded number of cases.
- Tumor differentiation plays a crucial role in **cancer severity**.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Analysis)
- **Power Query** (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- **SQL/Python (Optional for Data Preprocessing)**

## 📜 Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into breast cancer patient demographics, treatment stages, and survival rates. The findings can aid in early diagnosis and better decision-making in healthcare.
